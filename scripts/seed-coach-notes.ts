				},
				{
					weekNumber: midWeek,
					content:

				{
					weekNumber: midWeek,
					content:
						'The gap between effort (8-9) and performance (3-5) is persistent and frustrating for Sam. We identified two root causes: working on wrong priorities and not making completed work visible. Introduced a "work audit" where Sam tags each task as high/medium/low impact.'

					content:
						'The effort-performance gap remains the core challenge. Progress is slow but there are signs of improvement in prioritization. Sam started sending weekly "completed work" summaries and Ryan (Director) noted increased visibility. Next cycle: deeper work on strategic thinking.'

					content:
						'Breakthrough! Riley ran their first A/B test independently and the results drove a product decision. Scores jumped dramatically in weeks 9-10. Jessica (Product Director) called it "a transformation." This validates the patient approach. Riley is now self-motivated and building momentum.'
